# Welcome!
My name is Randy and I am a business analyst, and I mainly work with SQL, Python, HTML, and CSS. I am currently in graduate school for mathematics.
I have a strong interest in programming and data because I think it is a good outlet for applied mathematics and critical thinking.

# Projects
## [Project 1: EDA Indian Covid Data](https://github.com/lazyrandy/EDA-Indian-Covid-Data)
### Background
SARS-CoV-2 is virus that is a member of the coronavirus family, and in early 2019 it was recognized as a pandemic. This pandemic has affected many aspects of society, and has exacerbated the need for health care workers for hospitals around the world. I approached this problem from the perspective of a data analyst working for a health staffing company in India, where the main business request was finding what states should be the main focus of company efforts.

## [Project 2: Wine Review EDA](https://github.com/lazyrandy/Wine_Review_EDA)
### Background
Here, I analyze wine data to see how one could enter the wine market successfully. I start by looking at the most popular wines by counting reviews, and in the second part of the study I look at the geographic cost of land, labor, and equipment.
