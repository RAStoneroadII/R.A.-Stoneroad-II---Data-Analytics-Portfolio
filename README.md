## [Project 1: EDA Indian Covid Data](https://github.com/lazyrandy/EDA-Indian-Covid-Data)
### Background
SARS-CoV-2 is virus that is a member of the coronavirus family, and in early 2019 it was recognized as a pandemic. This pandemic has affected many aspects of society, and has exacerbated the need for health care workers for hospitals around the world. I approached this problem from the perspective of a data analyst working for a health staffing company in India, where the main business request was finding what states should be the main focus of company efforts.
